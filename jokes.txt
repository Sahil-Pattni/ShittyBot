A Canadian fellow, a Russian comrade and a Frenchman are all sitting around a campfire, armed with pistols.
The Russian pulls out a bottle of vodka, opens it and drinks around a quarter of it. He then throws it up into the air, draws his pistol, and shoots the bottle.
The Candian yells, "WTF!"

The Russian man responds, "In Russia, we have so much vodka, we can waste it like that."

The Frenchman nods his head, pulls out a bottle of wine...downs half and shoots the bottle.
The Canadian, dumbfounded, yells out again, "WTF!"
The Frenchman says, "It's the same in France with wine."

The Russian asks the Canadian, "Isn't there something in Canada you have a lot of that you can waste?"
After pondering for a few seconds, the Canadian draws his revolver and shoots the Frenchman.
